# ProjectAlpha

## Setup

### Python

The application is built using `python 3.8.10`

### Installing requirements

Move to bakcend directory:

```
cd backend
```

In the backend directory run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Note on macOS

You need to change the `tensorflow==2.11.0` requirement to `tensorflow-macos==2.11.0`

### libvoikko

You also need to have `libvoikko` installed on your environment.

#### macOS

```
brew install libvoikko
```

Also with macOS, in lemmatizer.py file uncomment the following line:

```
v = Voikko("fi")
```

and comment out the following lines:

```
Voikko.setLibrarySearchPath("./Voikko")
v = Voikko(language="fi", path="./Voikko")

```

#### linux

```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y voikko-fi python-libvoikko
```

#### windows

The project has the libvoikko dll library in the `backend/Voikko` directory so no need to install it.

## Running the backend application

### locally

in backend directory run

```
py backend.py
```

## Training the TensorFlow model

The model is trained when the backend server is started or the `backend/tensorflow_classifier.py` file is run. After that the model is saved in generated `backend/models` directory and loaded from there when the server is started after the first time. If you want to retrain the model, delete the generated
`backend/models` directory and start the server again.

### Modifying the training data

The training data for the TensorFlow model is located in `backend/responses.csv` file. To modify the training data you can modify that file and the retrain the model. Remember to delete the `backend/models` directory.

### Structure of the responses.csv file

There should be 2 columns "response" and "class". The delimeter is comma "," so if the response contains any commas the response should be inside quotations e.g. "moi, ei k√§y". The options for class column are currently accept, decline and suggestion.

## Swagger

Swagger dovumentation can be found in path `/apidocs/#/`

e.g. when run locally: `http://localhost:5000/apidocs/#/`

## Front-end application for testing

### Setup

Move to frontend directory:

```
cd frontend
```

In the frontend directory run:

```
npm install
```

### Running the frontend application

In the frontend directory run:

```
npm start
```

## Docker

in backend directory run:

```
docker build -t backend .
```

Then the application can be run with:

```
docker run -p 5000:5000 backend
```

NOTE: to change the port e.g. to 8080 you can do

```
-p 8080:5000
```

### docker compose

If you want to run both frontend and backend using docker, in root directory run:

```
docker compose up
```

Rebuilding the docker compose can be done with:

```
docker compose up --build
```

NOTE: When running with docker compose, the frontend path will be `8080:/` and the backend will be `8080:/api`
